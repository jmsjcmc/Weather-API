# üå§Ô∏è Weather API with Redis Caching

This is a simple Node.js API that fetches real-time weather data from the Visual Crossing Weather API and caches it using Redis to reduce redundant API calls.

## üöÄ Features

 -   Get current weather data by city name.
    
 -   Uses Redis as an in-memory cache to improve performance.
    
 -   Automatically refreshes cached data every 12 hours.
    
 -   Basic error handling for invalid cities or failed requests.
    
 -   Rate limiting to protect against abuse.

## üèóÔ∏è Tech Stack
Here are the main technologies used in this project, along with short and clear explanations:

-   **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/):**  
    A fast and lightweight JavaScript runtime used to build the server-side (backend) of this application.
    
-   **[Express.js](https://expressjs.com/):**  
    A web framework for Node.js that simplifies handling routes, requests, and responses.
    
-   **[Axios](https://axios-http.com/):**  
    A popular library used to make HTTP requests (like calling the weather API).
    
-   **[Redis](https://redis.io/):**  
    A fast, in-memory data store used here for caching weather results to improve speed and reduce external API usage.
    
-   **[ioredis](https://github.com/luin/ioredis):**  
    A Node.js library for connecting and interacting with a Redis database.
    
-   **[Visual Crossing Weather API](https://www.visualcrossing.com/weather-api):**

    A free and easy-to-use API that provides weather data for any city. This is where we get the actual weather information.
    
-   **[dotenv](https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv):**  
    A package that loads environment variables from a `.env` file. It helps keep sensitive info (like API keys) secure and outside of the main code.
    
-   **[express-rate-limit](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-rate-limit):**  
    A middleware that limits the number of requests from a single IP to prevent spamming or overloading the server.
## üì¶ Installation
#### 1. Clone the repo
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/weather-api.git
cd weather-api
```
#### 2.Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
#### 3.**Create a `.env` file** in the root directory and add the following:
```bash
# Server Configuration
PORT=3000

# Visual Crossing Weather API
WEATHER_API_KEY=your_api_key_here

# Redis Configuration
REDIS_URL=your_redis_url_here

# Cache TTL in seconds (43200 = 12 hours)
CACHE_TTL=43200
```
#### 4.Start the server
```bash
node index.js
```
## üì° API Usage
### Endpoint
```bash
GET /api/weather/:city
```
### Example
```bash
GET http://localhost:3000/api/weather/davao
```
### Response (sample)
```bash
{
  "address": "Davao, Philippines",
  "days": [
    {
      "datetime": "2025-05-13",
      "temp": 30.2,
      "conditions": "Partially Cloudy",
      ...
    }
  ]
}
```
## üß† How It Works
1.  When a user requests weather data for a city, the API first checks the Redis cache.
    
2.  If the data exists in the cache and hasn't expired, it returns the cached data.
    
3.  If not, it fetches data from the Visual Crossing API and stores it in Redis with a 12-hour TTL.
    
4.  Rate limiting is applied to prevent abuse (100 requests per 15 minutes per IP).
